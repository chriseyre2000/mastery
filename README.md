# Mastery

This is an attempt to work through the major example project from

`Designing Elixir Systems with OTP` (https://pragprog.com/book/jgotp/designing-elixir-systems-with-otp)

I have been following through the book working on the code snippets.

The only changes that I have made:

- Mastery.Examples.Maths is the correct name for the example project.
- I am using docker-compose.yml for the test databases.

This is being blogged about on https://devrants.blog
